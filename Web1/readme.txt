Here is readme.txt:

For the design of the web page, we adopted the title and framed content. It is divided into the Headerï¼Œsidebar, footer, and content. 
First, the essence of the content of the entire web page is summarized. Then the main content part is below.

When entering the interface, content 1 will be loaded. I inserted a video audio here. This video introduces why we should care for dogs and the touching moments between people and dogs. 
In order to attract attention and make the page more attractive.

We can see that there are four buttons on the left. When each button is clicked, the corresponding content will appear in the main content part.

For the first button (Hospital), we provide information about pet hospitals near Boston, including addresses, telephone numbers and names. 
This makes it easy for users to find nearby rescue places and help solve the problems encountered by dogs. In the code part, we adopted a table method, which looks more standardized. 
And we adopted a page method, so that each page loads 10 pieces of information, which will not make users look confused. Footers allow users to jump easily.

For the second button (Adoption List), a lot of dog information is provided here, including pictures, dog names, ages, weights and corresponding numbers. 
Numbers are helpful for users to consult when adopting dogs. For the code, we adopted the text embedded in the picture, and the text is semi-transparent, which looks more beautiful.

For the third button (Lost Information), it is dedicated to users who have found stray dogs or want to donate dogs (needing others to take care of them).
The information of the mobile phone user and the description of the dog, such as where the dog was found or the health status. For the code, we adopted the form of Form. 
And combined with the local storage method, Post request. Create a server.js local server, import and save the written data to data.txt. 
So that we can count the statistical information, contact the user after getting the information, and make contact.

For the fourth button (contact information), our contact information is provided here, so that users can contact us in the following ways if they have other questions. 
In the code part, we adopted simple information segmentation processing, and for Address, we adopted a hyperlink, so that users can click on the address, 
know our location more conveniently, and arrive better.

We also designed a logo and a website icon. All designs are combined with corresponding CSS, which makes the page look more beautiful. When we allow the program, 
we need to run node server.js to start the server and receive information. Then start the main page.
